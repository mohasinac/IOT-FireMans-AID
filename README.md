# Firemans Aid

We are developing an Arduino based fire fighting robot.

##Modules
###Arduino Board
Arduino is an open-source platform used for building IOT projects. It consists of both a physical programmable circuit board and a piece of software or IDE that runs on your computer, used to write and upload programmable code to the physical board.

###Flame Sensors
Flame sensors are incoporated to sense the fire and four such sensors are placed in four different directions of the robot to sense the direction of fire. The fire sensors have an IR Receiver which help in the detection of  fire and an Op-Amp will be used to check for change in voltage across the IR Receiver.

###Notifications
By using the feature of Arduino our bot can send a SMS to the owner of the place affected by fire irrespective of the location of the owner. The features of the Arduino also alerts the people in close proximity of the fire by Bluetooth connectivity and hence alerts people  not to get too close to the affected area.

###Others
It also involves the usage of  L293 and a Servo motor. L293 is a motor driver IC which helps the bot in the movement of its wheels.A servo motor  is used so that we can control the direction in which the water has to be sprayed.
